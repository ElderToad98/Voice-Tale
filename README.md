# What is Voice Tale?
Voice Tale is a no code program developed with TownSharp that allows server moderators and owners to create Voice Commands easily.

While this program may work, expect bugs.
Additionally, only open the project files if you are ready to face my ugly and uncommented and weirdly named code

# Built in Variables
- **{dynamicint 1234} (NOT WORKING)**
  In a speech command name, specify the amount of commands to generate based on the number used after `dynamicint`
  In the commmands to execute, use `{dynamicint}` to use the incremented integer generated.
  Please note that creating hundreds or thousands of commands with this will drastically increase loading times when opening Command Creation/Command Execution

  **EX:**
  
  **Command Name:**
  
    `give me {dynamicint 100} coins`

  **Commands to Execute:**
  
    `trade atm add 'Elder Toad' {dynamicint}`
